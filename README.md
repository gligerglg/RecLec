# RecLec-Updated

#Introduction

RecLec is a simple native mobile application which can be used to record your daily attendance of lectures
and analyze the average of attendance for each and every subjects. This android application is designed for
university students but this app also suits for the other users (Teachers, Lecturers) also.
Importance

There is a cut off mark in each and every universities which is calculated by the attendance of each and every student
and decide whether he or she is eligible for the examinations. Genarally the average is 80% in every universities.
If there is a student who has an average of attendance lower than 80% he or she will be unable to sit to the examination.
If we can mark our daily attendace for each subjects we can finally calculate the average.
Can you do that every day? I don’t think so. In a piece of paper, we can record them but what will happen if the paper is lost?
Everything gone! You can’t mark the attendance again because you are unable  to remember the previous attendances. 
  
  Here I do have a solution. The RecLec android app will let you record daily attendance of each and every subjects 
  and also it will calculate average of your attendance the day by day and show the information in fancy way. 

Technologies Used by the App

RecLec developed by using Android Studio which is free and open source development tool for all the android app developers. 
To store the subjects and the relevant days, I used SQLite database which is a  built-in database implementation 
comes with every Android OS and it supports all the relational database features.
